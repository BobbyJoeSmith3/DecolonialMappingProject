Lippit Mill
The Lippitt Mill is an historic mill at 825 Main Street in West Warwick, Rhode Island.

The cotton textile mill was built in 1809, making it the second oldest in Rhode Island after Slater Mill. The Lippitt Manufacturing Company was founded by Revolutionary War officer, Col. Christopher Lippitt, his brother Charles Lippitt, and Benjamin Aborn, George Jackson, Amasa Mason, and William Mason. During the Depression following of War of 1812 the Lippitt Manufacturing Company survived by supplying yarn to convict weavers in the Vermont prison. The company grew throughout the 19th century becoming a large profitable enterprise in which several generations of the Lippitt family were involved. In 1889 all of the Lippitt Company assets were sold to the firm of B.B. Knight & Robert Knight, founders of Fruit of the Loom. In 1925, B.B. Knight sold the Lippitt Mill property to Joseph Hayes, owner of the Riverpoint Lace Works. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The Hayes family stopped manufacturing lace here in the early 1970s, but they retained ownership of the property until it went into receivership in 2008. The mill continued operation until 2010, when spring flooding on the Pawtuxet River and a bad economy forced the mill to close.

A plan was announced in 2014 to convert the property to residences for people over 55.

The mill is on the National Register of Historic Places, and is one of the earliest textile mills in Rhode Island.

Allendale Mill
Allendale Mill is a historic mill at 494 Woonasquatucket Avenue in North Providence, Rhode Island, on the banks of the Woonasquatucket River.

The oldest buildings in the mill complex were built in 1822 by John Holden Greene for Zachariah Allen. The mill had various fire safety devices that were advanced for the time, including "heavy fire doors, sprinkler system, rotary fire pump, and copper-riveted fire hose to be used in American textile mills. In addition, Allen built a heavy fire wall separating the picker room (filled with highly flammable cotton fibers) from the rest of the mill and set the roofshingles in mortar."[2] The second building, also of 1822, was a company store building. It still stands next to the mill, facing Woonasquatucket Avenue.

Several additions were built onto the original building during the late 19th and 20th centuries. The first was a plain, white, 5-bay section in 1880. Later, two identical 9-bay red-brick additions were built in 1910 and 1947.[3]

The mill's 6 buildings over 5 acres (2.0 ha) were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.[1]

Pocasset Worsted Company Mill
The Pocasset Worsted Company Mill is an historic industrial complex at 75 Pocasset Street in Johnston, Rhode Island. It consists of a complex of four connected brick buildings, built between 1897 and 1902. The buildings form a rough U shape on a 3.38 acres (1.37 ha) parcel of land between Pocasset Street and the Pocasset River. The two legs of the U are nearly identical main mill buildings, constructed in 1897 and 1902; they are joined by an engine and boiler house. The mill office building is attached to the southern (1897) mill building. The Pocasset Worsted Company was Johnston's largest employer in the early 20th century; its buildings were used for textile production until 1989.[2]

The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[1]

Ashton Mill
The Ashton Historic District is a historic district in Cumberland, Rhode Island. The district consists of a mill and an adjacent mill village that was built for the workers of the mill. It lies between Mendon Road, Scott Road, Angell Road, Store Hill Road, Front Street and Middle Street. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 1, 1984.

In 1867, in a program of further expansion, the Lonsdale Company erected a large, three and-one-half-story, mansard-roof brick mill at Ashton on the east side of the Blackstone River north of Lonsdale. It was later enlarged to four full stories with a flat roof.[2]

A compact group of associated brick row houses and other buildings, including a handsome mansard-roofed office, also were built. This mill played a major role in 19th-century textile technology and was the site of the first large-scale test of the high-speed Sawyer spindle, one of the earliest of its type developed in the United States. The mill houses here are noteworthy for their simple form and dense arrangement. The village is tucked into a narrow, low flood plain site at the bottom of a bluff carrying Mendon Road (Rhode Island Route 122) in this section.

Dyerville Mill
The Dyerville Mill is an historic textile mill complex at 610 Manton Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. Its oldest buildings dating to 1835, it is one the oldest textile mill in the city. The complex is located between Manton Avenue and the Woonasquatucket River, just south of the Dyerville Mill Pond. Remnants of the head race run south from the pond, through the property, with the tail race exiting to the southwest. The main mill building is a 3-1/2 story L-shaped stuccoed stone structure. The picker house is a 2-1/2 story stone structure southwest of the main mill, with a brick extension that also gives it an L shape and creates a courtyard with the main building. A 20th-century warehouse stands south of this complex. The mill was established by Elisha Dyer, father of Elisha Dyer and grandfather of Elisha Dyer, Jr., and was operated by the Dyer family until 1867. It was then operated by cotton broker Truman Beckwith and his son. The Joslin Manufacturing Company purchased the business in 1903 and operated textile production on the site until the 1930s. The site has thereafter seen other light industrial uses.[2]

The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[1]

The building is now home to The Groden Network of Services.

Royal Mill
The Royal Mill Complex is an historic textile mill site at 125 Providence Street in West Warwick, Rhode Island. The mill complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. It has recently been completely renovated and remodeled into 250 residential apartments. The complex also includes the Ace Dye Works mill on the south side of the river, which has been converted into lofts. A pedestrian skybridge connects the two mills.

The complex is located along the banks of the South Branch of the Pawtuxet River in the village of River Point.

The site was first used for industrial purposes by the Greene Manufacturing Company, which built a wooden structure in 1809 and two later stone mills.[2] In 1885, the site was purchased by B.B.& R. Knight Co., one of the largest textile companies in Rhode Island at the time, who marketed their cloth under the Fruit of the Loom label. In 1890, the Knight Company razed the three old mills and built the Royal Mill from local granite. The new mill would become one of the largest in the company's empire of 22 mills throughout the region.

In 1919, the Royal Mill was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt a year later in the current configuration, with twin stone towers. In 1921, the Royal Mill was the scene of a huge textile worker strike that lasted 33 weeks. The impact of the strike as well as increased competition from Southern mills led to many mill closures throughout New England during the 1920s. The Royal Mill survived until 1935, when the once mighty B.B.& R. Knight Co. went bankrupt.

Between 1936 and 1946 the site was occupied by Saybrooke Manufacturing Co., which produced wool cloth. After this time, and until 2004 the mill was used by a variety of small companies.[3]

The mill was abandoned and taken over by the town of West Warwick, Rhode Island in 1993, and there was serious consideration for demolishing the structure.

Shady Lea Mill
The Mill at Shady Lea, situated on the Mattatuxet River, stands today as a tribute to all those men and women who worked hard throughout the past contributing to the fortunes of the mill dynasties and the economy of early America.

The east part of the mill was built in the late 1820s by Esbon Sanford to manufacture a fabric that was cross between burlap and  the dungaree fabric of today called Kentucky Jean.  Sanford was one of the early pioneers of the textile industry in North Kingstown and was also involved in the beginnings of the Annaquatucket and Narragansett mills.  In 1832 Mr. Sanford sold out to Edward Tillinghast. From its inception, right up until its purchase by Rodman Manufacturing in 1871, the mill was known as the Springdale Factory.  In 1836 the mill again changed hands and was bought by Christopher Allen who sold to his brother Charles in 1840. Charles manufactured flannels, linsey-wooleys and cassimeres until 1856. From 1856 to 1867 the mill was owned by a group of investors headed by brothers Royal and Walter Chapin; Walter Chapin was a well-known General in the RI Militia. The Chapin’s also were the founders of the Chapin Mill at the corner of Brown St. and Boston Neck Road in the village of Wickford. During the Civil War, under the direction of General Chapin, woolen blankets were made for the Union Army at Shady Lea. From 1867 to 1871, the mill was owned by a woman named Mary Ellsworth, who ran it with the assistance of her husband Alexander and son Albert, who was an accomplished bookkeeper.  Mary Ellsworth must have been a remarkable person, as it was very unusual for a woman to be the owner of such a large business in the middle of the 19th century. In 1871, the mill was purchased from Mary Ellsworth by Robert Rodman, and used primarily as a location where warps were set up for final weaving in Rodman’s other mills. It is believed that it was he who expanded the building to the west. Albert Ellsworth stayed on working for Rodman and continued as the mill’s bookkeeper. It was the Rodman’s that began calling the mill Shady Lea Mill. The mill stayed in the Rodman family until 1952 when Rodman Manufacturing closed up shop due to competition from textile mills in the south.

The Springdale Factory/Shady Lea Mill – What Was Made Here

Kentucky Jean – A very coarse woven fabric made of cotton and wool. Most often this fabric was manufactured for the Negro Goods trade, a very lucrative business where fabrics made in southern Rhode Island were sold to slave owners, and later share cropper plantation owners, for use as clothing for field workers. The extremely durable nature of this burlap like fabric attracted western mining suppliers like Levi Strauss, who made sturdy work pants out of it for sale to miners during the western gold rush period.

Linsey-Woolsey – A coarse woven fabric made from linen and wool. Also used in the Negro Goods trade.

Cassimere – A high quality woolen fabric used for men’s suiting and women’s skirts and dresses. It generally was made as a twill; a woven fabric with a pattern of diagonal parallel ribs.

Flannel – A soft woven fabric with no nap, made from finely carded wool.

Warps – A fabric is made of two lays of yarn, the warp which runs longitudinal throughout the fabric and the weft which is the yarn woven back and forth perpendicular to the warp. Large scale broadcloth manufacture requires 100’s of warps many hundreds of feet long to be set up on a warp beam and rolled up precisely with out crossing or tangling, ready to be placed upon a loom and woven with a weft.  Setting warps is a time-consuming and exacting job. Warps set up at Springdale Factory/Shady Lea Mill during the Rodman era, were transported to either the Silver Spring Mill just up stream on the Mattatuxet River, or the main mill at Lafayette, which utilized the Shewatuck River, for final weaving into fabric.

Slate Mill
The Slater Mill is a historic textile mill complex on the banks of the Blackstone River in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, modeled after cotton spinning mills first established in England. It is the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in North America to utilize the Arkwright system of cotton spinning as developed by Richard Arkwright.

Samuel Slater, the mill's founder, apprenticed as a young man in Belper, England with industrialist Jedediah Strutt. Shortly after immigrating to the United States, Slater was hired by Moses Brown of Providence, Rhode Island to produce a working set of machines necessary to spin cotton yarn using water power. Construction of the machines was completed in 1793, as well as a dam, waterway, waterwheel, and mill. Manufacturing was based on Richard Arkwright's cotton spinning system, which included carding, drawing, and spinning machines. Slater initially hired children and families to work in his mill, establishing a pattern that was replicated throughout the Blackstone Valley and known as the "Rhode Island System". It was later eclipsed by Francis Cabot Lowell's Waltham System.

Slater Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966, the first property to be listed on the register.[1][3] In December 2014, the mill was added to the newly formed Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.

The original portion of the Slater Mill built in 1793 was six bays long and two stories tall. Several additions were made beginning in 1801, and a second added in 1835. Between 1869 and 1872, a large addition was made to the north end of the mill. Cotton spinning continued until 1895, after which the mill was used for various industrial purposes until 1923. The building had suffered numerous fires in the past, and two fires occurred in 1912 which precipitated awareness of the building and the need for its preservation.

Wanskuck Mill
The Wanskuck Historic District is a historic district in the city of Providence, Rhode Island encompassing a mill village with more than two hundred years of history. As early as the mid-18th century, mills stood on the West River in northern Providence, a development which continued with the rise of industrialization in the 19th century. The mill village of Wanskuck is organized around three thoroughfares: Branch Street, Veazie Street, and Woodward Road, and is roughly bounded on the east by Louisquisset Pike (Rhode Island Route 146) and to the northwest by the city line with North Providence. The West River runs through the district, with its banks lined by two late-19th-century mill complexes. The village area includes a variety of examples of mill worker housing, from duplexes to rowhouses, as well as two church complexes and a community hall built in 1884 by the Wanskuck Company.[2]

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanskuck_Historic_District

The Wanskuck Company was founded in 1862 by Jesse Metcalf, Henry J. Steere, and Stephen J. Olney to manufacture woolens and worsted clothes. This mill was built partly because of the scarcity of cotton cloth in the North during the Civil War. Because of the mills’ rapid success, expansions were made by Henry Steere on Wild Street in 1884 and on Douglas Avenue by the company in 1893. They were named Steere Mills and Geneva Mills. The company expanded its operations outside of Providence, building both Mohegan and Oakland Mills.
